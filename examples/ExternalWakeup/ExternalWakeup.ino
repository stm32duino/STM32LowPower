/*
  ExternalWakeup

  This sketch demonstrates the usage of External Interrupts (on pins) to wakeup
  a chip in sleep mode. Sleep modes allow a significant drop in the power usage
  of a board while it does nothing waiting for an event to happen.
  Battery powered application can take advantage of these modes to enhance
  battery life significantly.

  In this sketch, pressing a pushbutton attached to pin will wake up the board.

  This example code is in the public domain.
