/*
  ExternalWakeup

  This sketch demonstrates the usage of External Interrupts (on pins) to wakeup a chip in sleep mode.
  Sleep modes allow a significant drop in the power usage of a board while it does nothing waiting for an event to happen. Battery powered application can take advantage of these modes to enhance battery life significantly.

  In this sketch, shorting pin 8 to a GND will wake up the board.

  This example code is in the public domain.

void repetitionsIncrease() {
  // This function will be called once on device wakeup
  // You can do some little operations here (like changing variables which will be used in the loop)
  // Remember to avoid calling delay() and long running functions since this functions executes in interrupt context
